#the scope bug

scope  bug as refferred by  effective python occurs when you assign a variable in a new scope 
take this problem in a closure
def outer_function(items):
  found=false
  def inner_function(item):
  for value in items:
    if value is  item:
       found=true
       return value





   group.sort(key=inner_function)
   return found
 most would assume that given an iterable  to the outer function the expected value would be true if item exists however in python3 variable assignment is very special first  it checks whether the variable exists within the scope if it does the new value is assigned to the variable else a new variable is   created with the valuer

 however there is a solution to this one you can use the unlocal keyword  or  make  a class
